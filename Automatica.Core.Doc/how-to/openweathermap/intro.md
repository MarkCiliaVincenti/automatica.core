# Open Weather Map
Open Weather Map can be used to retrieve weather information in your area!

## Automatica.Core configuration
First you need to create the OWM driver.

OWM will create all available child nodes by default.

Now you need to enter your API Key in the property field.

### Geolocation
Automatica.Core uses the geolocation defined in your Global settings. Those settings can be viewed/edited on the root node of your configuration.

## OWM API Key
Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and create an account. After that go to API Keys. There should be created a "default" key after your registration. Anyway I would suggest you to create a new one for your Automatica.Core configuration.

Enter this API Key in the property field, save & reload.
