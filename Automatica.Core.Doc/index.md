# Automatica.Core 
Automatica.Core is a building management software written in .NET Core.

## Why another building automation system?
My intention in Automatica.Core was to build a system which can run on different hardware and different operating sytems. In case of a "Smart Home" you can run Automatica.Core on a RaspberryPi using the image in the download section.
In case of a shopping mall where you have 10.000 or event more datapoints to manage, you can run Automatica.Core on a Windows or a Linux x64 machine.

Also a big reason why I used .NET C# - it is easy to unterstand. Everybody who knows C# can write drivers/logics for the system.


## Why a new automation server?
Because I can :) And I don't like the other systems available on the market.
