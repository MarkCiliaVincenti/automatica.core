# Automatica.Core (YaaS)
Automatica.Core is a building management software written in .NET Core.

## Why YaaS? (Yet another automation server)
My intention in Automatica.Core was to build a system which can run on different hardware and different operating sytems. In case of a "Smart Home" you can run Automatica.Core on a RaspberryPi using the image in the download section.
In case of a shopping mall where you have 10.000 or event more datapoints to manage, you can run Automatica.Core on a Windows or a Linux x64 machine.

## Why a new automation server?
Because I can :) And I don't like the other systems available on the market. 

## Developers
